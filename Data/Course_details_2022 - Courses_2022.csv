noc22-bt54,Conservation Geography,"Geography is the study of areal differentiation. It examines three questions - 1. What features (say mountains) and processes (such as volcanism) are found in different locations? 2. Why are they located where they are? 3. Where else on Earth do we find these specific features and processes? This governs several developmental decisions, such as location of mines, factories, towns, cities, and infrastructure. After all, mining will be economically feasible in areas that have a concentration of ores. Factories can easily be set up where we have availability of land, labour, capital and infrastructure. Towns and cities require land, infrastructure, water, etc. But at the same time, areal differentiation also governs the localisation of biodiversity - forests, wildlife, etc. - which need to be conserved to provide us with ecosystem benefits like food, water, disease control and employment. Past experience shows that if we are not careful, hasty developmental decisions harm biodiversity and conservation - especially when, say, developing mines in biodiversity-rich areas. This ultimately affects all of us - destruction of ecosystems, water flows and pollution wreck havoc to food and water security, health and economic development.

noc22-bt55,Wildlife Ecology,"The times are changing: we live in an era when issues such as climate change, over population, pollution, habitat loss and mass extinction of species are no longer just academic concepts; we are witnessing them in our daily lives and suffering their consequences. We are continuously trashing our planet and harming ourselves in the process. And this is when we know so much about what the issues are, how and why they arise, and how they can be solved. We have the technological solutions; and still we?re largely unable to actually solve the problems. This is largely because these problems require not just a technological solution ? they also require reworking of national and global policies. And solving the problems will entail costs and require money ? such as for treating waste water before disposal, for increasing the efficiency of resource utilisation to reduce overconsumption of resources, for shifting to greener sources of energy that don?t emit greenhouse gases, for shifting to green chemistry that doesn?t pollute, for making infrastructures that do not harm the wildlife, and for incentivising more research to make better technologies. It is these costs, and not just a lack of technology, that prevent us from solving the problems. Thus, the need of the hour is to understand the Economics of Conservation to create an environment where we can use technologies to solve our problems. In this course, we shall look at the processes of Conventional Economics that have led to the destruction of the environment by putting profits above everything, and how we can solve these issues of Conventional Economics with a better understanding of Economics ?

operations which involve mixing, heating/cooling, reactions and flow. The efficiency of these
processes is critically dependent on the transport of heat and mass carried along with flowing
fluid, and across solid/fluid interfaces. The transport across interfaces is entirely due to
molecular diffusion, which is the transport in a stationary fluid due to gradients in concentration
or temperature. The combination of convection (transport by flowing fluids) and diffusion
determine the rate of transport, and the overall efficiency, in unit operations. In this course, we
will obtain a physical understanding of how the balance between convection and diffusion
determines the overall transport rates in chemical processes, and gives rise to many of the
empirical correlations used in chemical engineering design.",Prof. V.

noc22-cs06,AI:Constraint Satisfaction,"Human beings solve problems in many different ways. Problem solving in artificial intelligence (AI) is inspired from these diverse approaches. AI problem solvers may be based on search, on memory, or on knowledge representation and reasoning. An approach to problem solving is to pose problems as constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), and employ general methods to solve them. The task of a user then is only to pose a problem as a CSP, and then call an off-the-shelf solver. CSPs are amenable to combining search based methods with reasoning. In this 2 credit course we will look at general approaches to solving finite domain CSPs, and explore how search can be combined with constraint propagation to find solutions.

noc22-cs103,Programming in Modern C++,"There has been a continual debate on which programming language/s to learn, to use. As the latest TIOBE Programming Community Index for August 2021 indicates â€“ C (13%), Python (12%), C++ (7%), Java (10%), and C#(5%) together control nearly half the programming activities worldwide. Further, C Programming Language Family (C, C++, C#, Objective C etc.) dominate more than 25% of activities. Hence, learning C++ is important as one learns about the entire family, about Object-Oriented Programming and gets a solid foundation to also migrate to Java and Python as needed. C++ is the mother of most general purpose of languages. It is multi-paradigm encompassing procedural, object-oriented, generic, and even functional programming. C++ has primarily been the systems language till C++03 which punches efficiency of the code with the efficacy of OOP. Then, why should I learn it if my primary focus is on applications? This is where the recent updates of C++, namely, C++11 and several later offer excellent depths and flexibility for C++ that no language can match. These extensions attempt to alleviate some of the long-standing shortcomings for C++ including porous resource management, error-prone pointer handling, expression semantics, and better readability. The present course builds up on the knowledge of C programming and basic data structure (array, list, stack, queue etc.) to create a strong familiarity with C++98 / C++03. Besides the constructs, syntax and semantics of C++ (over C), we also focus on various idioms of C++ and attempt to go to depth with every C++ feature justifying and illustrating them with several examples and assignment problems.

In a nutshell, a MPC protocol allows a set of mutually distrusting parties with private inputs, to perform any joint computation on their data, by keeping their respective data as private as possible. Secure MPC abstracts several real-world problems, for example privacy-preserving data mining, privacy-preserving ML, secure e-auctions, private matchmaking, secure set-intersection, secure e-voting, secure signal-processing, secure bioinformatics, secure biometrics, secure outsourcing, to name a few. 
Since the domain of secure computation is enormously vast, it is impossible to discuss every relevant topic in just a single course. Hence the plan is to cover the topics in two parts. The first part titled Secure Computation: Part I has been already offered. In that course, we covered a simpler form of adversarial setting, namely semi-honest adversary (passive adversary), where the corrupt parties are supposed to follow protocol instructions. However, real-life attackers may not be so benign and can cause the compromised parties to behave in any arbitrary fashion.

noc22-cs114,Introduction to Computer and Network Performance Analysis using Queuing Systems,"Analyzing the performance of any computer or networked system: such as Web application servers, packet scheduling disciplines, operating system schedulers, cellular telephony networks is an important step in the design and deployment of such systems. Performance of many systems can be measured, but a sound basis in queuing system models is required for two important aspects: 1) to ensure that the performance tests are performance field data is correct, and 2) for predicting the performance of a system in a scenario that cannot be measured. The theory of queues is a mathematical theory that helps model a wide range of computing and networking systems with a common abstraction of a queuing system. In this course, you will learn the most basic results in queuing systems, in an intuitive way, and learn how to apply them to computer and network systems performance. The focus in this short course will be on being able to reason about asymptotic values of performance metrics at high loads and low loads, which is very useful in validating results of performance tests. Practical examples of performance analysis of networked servers (e.g. a Web server), of packet network links, of cellular networks etc, will be provided.

noc22-cs116,Algorithmic Game Theory,"Game theory is the formal study of interaction between self-interested (or goal-oriented) systems (or agents or decision makers or players), and strategic scenarios that arise in such settings. It began life in Economics in the 1940's with the work of von Neumann and Morgenstern, but has since been applied to an extraordinary range of subjects, including political science, evolutionary biology and even to inspection regimes for arms control. 
Game theory has for years also played an important, if less recognized, role in several branches of computer science. Applications within computer science include the use of games in automated verification and model checking to model computing systems in an unknown and possibly adverse environment. In AI games are applied to the analysis of multi-agent systems. Recently, with the advent of the internet and e-commerce, many game theoretic questions in the interplay between economics and computing have received extensive attention. These include electronic auctions, and more generally mechanism design questions (inverse game theory) related to finding incentive structures for cooperation between independent entities on the internet.

Typically, these (software) controllers have to make decisions based on inputs coming from multiple interacting components. As the size and the number of interacting components increase, the design and verification of controllers becomes increasingly complex.
Model checking is a field of research that addresses this challenge by making use of mathematical models in the design and verification of controllers. The main idea is to look at the system as a mathematical model - commonly used models are extensions of finite-state machines. Design requirements on the controller then get translated to suitable questions on these mathematical models.The goal of this course is to understand some of the techniques and tools used in the process of model-checking. </p>",Prof. Srivathsan.B,CMI,IIT Madras,2021-11-14,2022-01-31,2021-12-13,2022-03-18,2022-04-23,2022-04-23,NULL,https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc22_cs25/preview,NULL,NULL,Jan-Apr 2022,30,Rerun,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,oc,https://nptel.ac.in/content/syllabus_pdf/106106136.pdf,106,NULL,106106136,NULL,NULL,38,1,SEM1,12,cs,Computer Science

noc22-cs43,Programming in Modern C++,"There has been a continual debate on which programming language/s to learn, to use. As the latest TIOBE Programming Community Index for August 2021 indicates – C (13%), Python (12%), C++ (7%), Java (10%), and C#(5%) together control nearly half the programming activities worldwide. Further, C Programming Language Family (C, C++, C#, Objective C etc.) dominate more than 25% of activities. Hence, learning C++ is important as one learns about the entire family, about Object-Oriented Programming and gets a solid foundation to also migrate to Java and Python as needed. C++ is the mother of most general purpose of languages. It is multi-paradigm encompassing procedural, object-oriented, generic, and even functional programming. C++ has primarily been the systems language till C++03 which punches efficiency of the code with the efficacy of OOP. Then, why should I learn it if my primary focus is on applications? This is where the recent updates of C++, namely, C++11 and several later offer excellent depths and flexibility for C++ that no language can match. These extensions attempt to alleviate some of the long-standing shortcomings for C++ including porous resource management, error-prone pointer handling, expression semantics, and better readability. The present course builds up on the knowledge of C programming and basic data structure (array, list, stack, queue etc.) to create a strong familiarity with C++98 / C++03. Besides the constructs, syntax and semantics of C++ (over C), we also focus on various idioms of C++ and attempt to go to depth with every C++ feature justifying and illustrating them with several examples and assignment problems. On the way, we illustrate various OOP concepts. The course also covers important advances in C++11 and later released features.

Furthermore, the algorithmic question of PIT is related to proving circuit lower bounds. We then move on to proofs, or attempts to prove, that certain problems are hard and impossible to express as a small circuit (i.e. hard to solve in real life too). One such problem is Permanent. We study the hardness against restricted models-- diagonal circuits, homogeneous depth-3, homogeneous depth-4, noncommutative formulas, multilinear depth-3, multilinear formulas, read-once ABP, etc. The partial derivatives, and the related spaces, of a circuit will be a key tool in these proofs.

noc22-cs99,Object Oriented Analysis and Design,"<p>The complexity of software systems is ever on the rise &ndash; more complex problem domains being attempted (complex embedded systems), ever growing man-power engaged in increasingly intricate development processes to turnaround in shorter and shorter time, possible flexibility of software being stretched to the limit with XaaS, platforms getting challenging with widely expanding distribution, cloud computation etc. Hence the analysis and design of software require well-organized and structured approaches to manage the challenges of complexity. </p><p>Over the past two decades methods of Object-Oriented Analysis, Design and Programming have proved to be effective solutions in handling the inherent complexity of software design, development, testing and maintenance. Concepts of OOAD like Abstraction, Encapsulation, Modularity, Hierarchy, Object, State, Behavior, Identity, Class, Operation, Interface, Inheritance, Association, Aggregation, Decomposition, Use-case, etc. have become the lingua franca for the software developers; ubiquitous notation of UML has firmly established itself as the vehicular language for design; and many object-based as well as object-oriented languages have become available and have been widely adopted1 &ndash; Java (21%), C++ (6%), C# (4%), VB / VB.NET (4%), Python (3%), Perl (2.5%), Ruby (2.5%), Objective-C (2%), Delphi/Object Pascal (2%), D (1%) &ndash; to name a few. Even out of C (14%) developers, a large section today adheres to OOAD / OOP principles. </p><p>The present course introduces OOAD grounds up starting with breaking down the root cause of inherent software complexity. After an in-depth exposure to Object Models, Classes and their interactions, the course takes a thorough tour of the diagrams of UML 2.0. Several systems examples help students understand the concept and tutorials offer quick practice. The course ends with a brief discourse on OOP in C++. </p><p>While this course can be followed independently (with some programming background), it would help in practicing OOP in C++ or Java. Hence this course is advised in conjunction with C++ / Java.</p>","Prof. Partha Pratim Das

noc22-cy23,Fundamentals of Spectroscopy,"Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction of light (electromagnetic radiation) with matter. Electromagnetic radiation covers a wide range of frequencies from gamma rays to radio frequencies. Depending on the frequency of radiation interacting with the matter, one can have different forms of spectroscopy. These spectroscopic techniques allow us to monitor the structural properties of matter. For example, information on moment of inertia (and hence bond length) can be obtained from rotational spectrum. Similarly, vibrational spectrum provides information on the force constant, i.e. the strength of a chemical bond.

Besides providing information on molecular structure, spectroscopic techniques can also be used for quantitative estimation of a substance making spectroscopy an important analytical tool. Further, a spectroscopic transition is characterized by a definite timescale and this can provide information on molecular dynamics. 

In this course, the fundamental principles of the different forms of spectroscopy will be elaborated in a unified way from both theoretical and experimental viewpoints. Application of these different spectroscopic methods for the elucidation of molecular structure will also be discussed. The structural and dynamic aspects of spectroscopy are fundamental to physics, chemistry and biology. Thus, this course will provide a thorough conceptual understanding for these branches of science.","Prof. Sayan Bagchi

noc22-ee12,Microprocessors And Microcontrollers,"Microprocessors are used extensively in the design of any computing facility. It contains units to carry out arithmetic and logic calculations, fast storage in terms of registers and associated control logic to get instructions from memory and execute them. A number of devices can be interfaced with them to develop a complete system application. On the other hand, microcontrollers are single chip computers, integrating processor, memory and other peripheral modules into a single System-on-Chip (SoC). Apart from input-output ports, the peripherals often include timers, data converters, communication modules, and so on. The single chip solution makes the footprint of the computational element small in the overall system package, eliminating the necessity of additional chips on board. However, there exists a large range of such products. While the simpler microcontrollers are cheap, their capabilities (in terms of program size and analog and digital peripherals) are also limited. Such processors may be suitable for small applications. Microcontrollers like 8051, PIC belong to this category. On the other hand, advanced microcontrollers are often much more powerful, comparable to the very advanced microprocessors. The AVR and ARM processors are of this category.",Prof. Santanu Chattopadhyay,IIT Kharagpur,IIT Kharagpur,2021-11-14,2022-01-31,2021-12-13,2022-03-18,2022-04-23,2022-04-23,NULL,https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc22_ee12/preview,NULL,NULL,Jan-Apr 2022,30,Rerun,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,oc,https://nptel.ac.in/content/syllabus_pdf/108105102.pdf,108,NULL,108105102,NULL,NULL,38,0,SEM1,12,ee,Electrical Engineering

noc22-ee20,Spread Spectrum Communications and Jamming,"A spread spectrum communication system deliberately spreads the spectrum of the signal beyond the required bandwidth needed for information transmission to achieve resilience against hostile jamming, low probability of intercept resulting detectability to be almost impossible as compared to non-spread signals, inherent message privacy and security, good rejection of multipath signals, high degree of ranging precision (due to the large bandwidth involved), and compatibility with code division multiple access (CDMA) capability. Originally adopted in military networks as a means of ensuring secure communication when confronted with the threats of jamming and interception, spread spectrum systems are now the core of commercial applications such as mobile cellular and satellite communications. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is the first commercial communication system that uses spread spectrum signals enabling ranging, jamming protection, multipath protection and high degree of range precision. In today’s world, there are more applications of spread spectrum on the commercial side than on the military side. CDMA is a popular multiple access scheme where several users share the same physical medium, that is, the same frequency at the same time. CDMA is based on spread spectrum technique where the spectral band is spread by multiplying each user’s signal by unique orthogonal pseudorandom sequence. Orthogonality of the codes ensures the retrieval of information without interference from each other where spreading allows the receiver to take benefit from multipath properties of the mobile radio channel. Over the years, the most successful implementation of spread spectrum communication in commercial world lies in cdma 2000, WCDMA and UMTS, a 3G mobile communication system, WLAN, Ultra Wideband Communications (UWB), Body Area Networks, and energy efficient Radio Architecture design for future generation Millimeter Wave (mmWave) communications. The common cordless phone utilizes spread spectrum technology to provide a telephonic interference-rejecting communication link in both 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz bands. In addition, spread spectrum communication methods have been considered an alternative to hard wiring for indoor private branch offices, laboratories, or factories where the transmission medium involves severe multipath fading.

The present course introduces basic principle of spread spectrum techniques, key concept of code designing supported by Galois field mathematics, understanding Jamming environment and interference handling mechanisms. The theoretical principles are tempered with their practical significance to cope up with the interest to both researchers and system designers. Learning is facilitated by streamlined derivations, tutorials, and assignments. Several systems examples help students understand the concept and tutorials offer quick practice. After an in–depth exposure to spread spectrum techniques and wireless cellular environment the course takes a thorough tour of training on wireless multiuser system design with spread spectrum technique in MATLAB platform. The course ends with an expose to cdma2000 and WCDMA protocol structure and brief introduction to low probability of intercept methods.",Prof. Debarati Sen,IIT Kharagpur,IIT Kharagpur,2021-11-14,2022-01-31,2021-12-13,2022-03-18,2022-04-24,2022-04-24,NULL,https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc22_ee20/preview,NULL,NULL,Jan-Apr 2022,30,Rerun,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,oc,https://nptel.ac.in/content/syllabus_pdf/117105136.pdf,108,NULL,117105136,NULL,NULL,39,1,SEM1,12,ee,Electrical Engineering

This applies to systems such as smart cities, transportation systems, power grids, gaming and financial markets. This complex subject requires simultaneous application of control theory and communication theory. At present these elements are taught separately in courses designed either exclusively for deterministic control theory, or exclusively for communication theory. This leaves behind a gap, namely blending insights from both disciplines to arrive at approaches for networked control problems. This course seeks to fill this gap.

noc22-ee95,Concentration inequalities,"It is well-known that functions of large numbers of random quantities tend to behave rather predictably and less randomly than their constituents. For instance, the laws of large numbers tell us that the average of many independent random variables is asymptotically the expected value. higher-order refinements such as the central limit theorem and large deviations techniques uncover the asymptotic rate at which this reduction in randomness takes place. However, if one is interested in sharper estimates, for the probability of deviation from the typical value, for a fixed number of observations, for functions other than the average, or for functions of dependent random variables, one must take recourse to more specific measure concentration bounds. Perhaps the most basic, nontrivial examples in this regard are the Markov and Chebyshev inequalities, which are encountered in a first course on probability.

 This graduate-level course on concentration inequalities will cover the basic material on this classic topic as well as introduce several advanced topics and techniques. The utility of the inequalities derived will be illustrated by drawing on applications from electrical engineering, computer science and statistics. A tentative list of topics is given below.

noc22-ge01,NBA Accreditation and Teaching and learning in Engineering (NATE),"The quality of Teaching and Learning in Engineering has come to be an important issue in India to all stakeholders including teachers, students, parents, Managements, University, AICTE, NBA, and Industry, especially after the introduction of new Accreditation Process introduced by NBA in 2015. The quality of learning of the graduating engineers determines the quality of their placements. While there was significant research in the last few decades in our understanding of how people learn, there have not been many intersections of this knowledge with the instructional practices at institutions of higher learning. The dominant instructional method still remains lecturing. Industry, Regulatory Bodies and Accreditation Agencies in India want the engineering graduates to attain a set of Program Outcomes (knowledge, skills, and attitudes) which are discipline agnostic and a set of Program Specific Outcomes identified by the Department offering the program. The curriculum of a program decides the nature of learning experiences, including the courses, projects, internships, and co-curricular and extra-curricular activities.
The focus on students attaining a specific set of outcomes requires a shift from a teacher-centric approach to student-centric instruction. While good teachers, in any era or in any part of the world, were and are always student-centric in their approach, the process of designing and conducting a course remained informal in nature. The contexts of instruction including quality and background of students, teacher expertise, the physical environment and the system in which instruction takes place, available resources, regulatory and accreditation mechanisms, and assessment and evaluation mechanisms are very varied. There is no unique method that leads to good learning in all contexts. The course addresses many of the common issues of teaching and learning in engineering in the Indian context and tries to provide a complete solution to a teacher to the process of design and conduct of an engineering course leaving all the academic freedom he/she wants to have. While at some places, the suggested solutions appear to be specific, they can be treated as examples, and alternate solutions can be worked out by the teacher.

In recent years there have been many changes/amendments in the clinical trial/new drug approval rules and regulations in India. It is important to know the right information as regulations can be misinterpreted. This knowledge when disseminated by the regulators themselves along with subject experts and experienced trainers, will have profound impact. Being an online course, it will address a larger section of public. Making it a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“free courseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ will allow many to acquire the knowledge at the comfort of their home without paying any money.

Version 1.0 of this online course was launched in early 2019 with 12 lectures as a four-week course. This online course (version 1.0) was attended by 1047 participants (Jan - Mar 2019). The release of the New Drugs and Clinical Trials (NDCT) Rules, 2019 on March 19, 2019 has steered a need to revise this online course as version 2.0 so that it can be updated with the recent advancements in regulatory knowledge. A series of brainstorming sessions were conducted by CDSA with CDSCO for incorporating the new updates, the feedback received (version 1.0 participants). Also, the deliberations from various face-to-face programs that were conducted by CDSA and inputs from the interactive session on NDCT Rules conducted by CDSA with CDSCO were incorporated to decide upon the contents of version 2.0. This course now has 24 lectures spread over a period of 8 weeks. This course also involves 8 weekly assignments and a final exit assessment. The exit assessment and weekly assignments are optional in nature. Only those who are willing to take certification exam by paying fees, can opt for this.

The course like version 1.0 is developed under the guidance of Shri A. B. Ramteke, Former Joint Drugs Controller (India) and presently Consultant, Regulatory Affairs at CDSA, THSTI, DBT along with CDSCO and subject experts. Few subject experts and trainers are invited to take 3-4 lectures to enrich the course. For example, CTRI lecture was taken by CTRI, ICMR.

Twenty-first century education structured should be outcome based which developed certain critical core competencies such as collaboration, digital literacy, critical thinking, and problem-solving, self learning. The curriculum should incorporates higher order thinking skills, multiple intelligences, technology and multimedia, communication skill and self learning methodology along with authenticated scientific assessments and evaluation. Curriculum should provide direction so that student can learn by themselves and work both independently and interdependently. The curriculum and instruction are designed to challenge all students, and provides for differentiation. So the curriculum is not a syllabus or textbook-driven or fragmented, it should be set of Specific, Measurable, Appropriate, Challenging but Achievable educational objective or Skills (outcome) which students will be acquire at the end. Evaluation of student achievement can be made more valid and reliable as the benchmark of achievements is explicitly stated.The course equips the learner with the tools and techniques for effective teaching and hand on practices through specially designed software with appropriate pedagogic framework for design outcome based curricula.

Both the UGC and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) recommend changes to the curriculum with a focus on IPR education in technical institutes.

Every stakeholder in an university, be it the administrators, the professors, the researchers or the students, now need to know the basics of intellectual property and learn how to identify, protect, manage and commercialise them.

Those who take this course should be able to:
Identify the different types of intellectual property generated by universities;
Understand the need for an innovation ecosystem and the benefits it brings to universities;
Know the requirements for setting up an IP centre and get practical training on how IP centres function; and

that everyone on the planet is affected by globalization but not in the same way. Yet most people have only a

fuzzy understanding of what globalization means because of the number of things it means to a wide variety of

people. The different dimensions of globalization such as the rise of global capital and markets, new media and

communication technologies, dissolution of political borders, and growth of consumerist culture cannot be

seen in isolation from one another. But people tend to examine them separately or through the

compartmentalized frames of different disciplines.

To provide a thorough grounding in the philosophical and theoretical debates on globalization



To examine the economic, political, social, cultural issues covered by the debate and their impact on

contemporary cultures, particularly in the developing world

noc22-hs116,Urbanization and Environment,"With more than 50% of the world population now residing in cities since 2008 (World Urbanization Prospects, 2007), we have reached the urban moment with huge implications of planetary urbanization on the environment. Urbanization is not a new phenomenon; the ancient cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, Ancient Greece, Rome and Mesopotamia are strong evidences. However, with our entry to the era of the Anthropocene, rapid urbanization with its rate, scale and shifting geographies (with intense urbanization in the global south: Asia, Africa and Latin America) is upsetting the ecological balance complemented with rising inequity, displacement and loss of livelihoods affecting the urban poor.

 What is the solution? Should urbanization be perceived as the key challenge and strategies must be devised to halt it, if not reverse it (as it is irreversible) Can there be other innovative alternatives that do not perceive cities as consumptive spaces swallowing ecological resources and generating highest ecological footprints, but also as contributors to ecological sustainability

 While policy prescriptions laid out in the UN Sustainable Urbanization framework or Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer technocratic directions and guidelines, it is extremely important to empirically investigate the relationship cities and their wider environments to not only identify challenges but also map potentials and learn lessons towards the development of a robust resilient urban environmental matrix that will not only be technically sound and feasible but also informed by socio-economic and political realities and determinants. With lessons from emerging urban social sciences frameworks such as urban environmental history and urban political ecology and with the empirical focus on South Asia, the course will shed light on cities as complex socio-natural-technical assemblages, encompassing elaborate technical apparatus and intricate social arrangements evolved along shifting temporal scales and development imperatives.

noc22-hs135,An Introduction to Indian Literary Theory,"Poetics is the theory of literary forms and devices, and the term is familiar to us mainly through the Greek philosopher Aristotle’s work of the same name. Aristotle’s Poetics is believed to be an incomplete treatise and the work that we have with us today is a systematic attempt to define only one genre, namely the art of tragedy. The treatise explores the various aspects of the genre, providing answers to what goes into the making of a tragedy and how it evokes the right kind of aesthetic response in a spectator. This attempt to systematize the study of poetry or all forms of literary composition is not specific to Greek or western literature but can be found in all literatures worthy of the name. In the Indian literary history, the term poetics in its broadest sense was concerned with two domains of art, namely nÄá¹­ya (play which blended drama, music, and dance) and kÄvya (poetry and other forms of literary composition). The factors that distinguished nÄá¹­ya from kÄvya in terms of form as well as content were so discernible that Sanskrit poetics virtually got bifurcated into two streams, namely nÄá¹­yaÅ›Ästra and kÄvyaÅ›Ästra. The nÄá¹­yaÅ›Ästra tradition of poetics, as the term denotes, focused primarily on nÄá¹­ya or performance of plays on stage with the accompaniment of dance and music; these aspects were technically termed in Sanskrit as Äá¹…gika (pertaining to gestures) vÄcika (verbal elements) ÄhÄrya (make-up and dress) and sÄttvika abhinaya (representation of emotions). KÄvyaÅ›Ästra, on the other hand, was exclusively concerned with the ontology of kÄvya (poetry and literary prose). The proposed course aims to introduce the students to the eight major schools in Indian aesthetics which functioned as the foundation of these two streams of poetics, such as rasa, dhvani, vakrokti, aucitya, alaá¹…kÄra, anumÄna, guá¹‡a and doá¹£a.",Prof. Sreenath V.S,IISER Bhopal,IIT Madras,2022-05-20,2022-07-25,NULL,NULL,2022-10-30,2022-10-30,NULL,https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc22_hs135/,NULL,NULL,Aug-Oct 2022,20,New,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,uptc,https://archive.nptel.ac.in/content/syllabus_pdf/109106195.pdf,109,NULL,109106195,NULL,NULL,42,1,SEM2,8 ,hs,Humanities and Social Sciences

noc22-hs138,Literary and Cultural Disability Studies: An Exploration,"Like other human conditions, disability offers a unique vantage position in the understanding of cultural expressions such as literature, folklore, and film. Such a vantage position derives from disabilitys capacity to offer novel frameworks for interpreting academic institutions such as literary criticism. Why that should be the case? 

Human capacities, abilities, vulnerabilities, and a spectrum of sentiments determine how long, and in what direction an idea travels. Likewise, conditions such as madness may instill newer narrative dispersions that one can ill afford to ignore. Literary and Cultural Disability Studies (LCDS) is the most appropriate forum for examining such narrative maneuverings. That said, LCDS is much more than that. For example, as a lens for exploring literary and cultural arrangements, LCDS may aid us in addressing the following questions differently:

1 The canon question.
2 The art of interpretation involving text and contexts.
3 The multilingual question. To comprehend the enduring connect between disability politics and the multilingual question, we have an elaborate workshop on Indian Sign Language (ISL). And 
4 Interdisciplinarity and the problem of accommodation. 

An engagement with these questions renders LCDS as a sequel to my introductory course on Disability Studies. Students pursuing masters in literature, culture, and social sciences broadly may appreciate the diversity of content in this course. For those who are pursuing doctoral and postdoctoral research, this course may come handy too. It hosts lectures and conversations on methods, frameworks, and approaches concerning culture, language, and politics.

However, modeling spatial data and spatial relationships necessitate the use of analytic tools beyond the standard statistical methods such as the ordinary least squares. Characterisation of spatial autocorrelation in spatial datasets for the purpose of statistical inference and statistical prediction is a focus of this course. In addition, we will ask: how and why does spatial autocorrelation arise; how is it measured and understood; how does it relate to issues of spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence; and how these factors inform the specification and estimation of regression models.

noc22-hs28,Language and Mind,Language learning can be put under three broad perspectives. Some believe language is pairing of lexicon and syntax i.e. of words and the set of rules that defines how we can combine those words most fundamental of these rules are innate i.e. they are already there in the human mind before it is exposed to society. This means there is perhaps an innate Language Faculty. Still others believe that General Cognitive Abilities that account for other kinds of learning can also account for language. There are many others who strongly believe that language is essentially socially embedded and that all learning takes place through social interactions. This course will briefly account for the most convincing position and will argue for it from generative perspective and biological foundations of language. Throughout the course we will try to be familiar with relationship between language and human mind; to understand language as a special purpose cognitive ability; and to understand underlying mental computation for natural language processing.,Prof. Rajesh Kumar,IIT Madras,IIT Madras,2021-11-14,2022-01-31,2021-12-13,2022-02-18,2022-03-27,2022-03-27,NULL,https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc22_hs28/preview,NULL,NULL,Jan-Mar 2022,20,Rerun,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,oc,https://nptel.ac.in/content/syllabus_pdf/109106085.pdf,109,NULL,109106085,NULL,NULL,37,0,SEM1,8 ,hs,Humanities and Social Sciences

The Act also attempts to bring in transparency and accountability in the working of â€˜public authoritiesâ€™. The interpretation of the Act has seen interesting developments, such as, which Institutions are accountable to provide information under the definition of â€˜Public Authorityâ€™? Whether information can be provided to non-citizens? What is the content of the â€˜right to Informationâ€™? What kind of information is exempted? Increasingly, the Courts have been called upon to interpret various provision of this Act, hence the case law development have contributed enormously to the jurisprudence of transparency law in India.

noc22-ma06,Introduction to Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra,"Algebraic geometry played a central role in 19th century math. The deepest results of Abel, Riemann, Weierstrass, and the most important works of Klein and Poincar/’e were part of this subject. In the middle of the 20th century algebraic geometry had been through a large reconstruction. The domain of application of its ideas had grown tremendously, in the direction of algebraic varieties over arbitrary fields and more general complex manifolds. Many of the best achievements of algebraic geometry could be cleared of the accusation of incomprehensibility or lack of rigour. The foundation for this reconstruction was (commutative) algebra. In the 1950s and 60s have brought substantial simplifications to the foundation of algebraic geometry, which significantly came closer to the ideal combination of logical transparency and geometric intuition. Commutative algebra is essentially the study of the rings occurring in algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. In algebraic number theory, the rings of algebraic integers in number fields constitute an important class of commutative rings — the Dedekind domains. This has led to the notions of integral extensions and integrally closed domains. The notion of localization of a ring (in particular the localization with respect to a prime ideal leads to an important class of commutative rings — the local rings. The set of the prime ideals of a commutative ring is naturally equipped with a topology — the Zariski topology. All these notions are
widely used in algebraic geometry and are the basic technical tools for the definition of scheme theory — a generalization of algebraic geometry introduced by Grothendieck.",Prof. Dilip P.

This is regarded as a very powerful tool by the researchers working on the theory of differential equations. However, as the topic demands expertise on both PDE and probability theory, an initiative to teach the topic as a structured course is vastly absent globally, including in India. There is hardly any lecture note or a course accessible for the mathematics students. There is no book for mathematics students which focuses on this topic and assembles all important aspects suitable for an introduction to this topic. Young researchers like PhD students or junior postdoctoral fellows, who aspire to learn the topic, resorts on several different books and study by themselves, which often consumes considerable amount of their productive time.

I have offered this once informally at IISER Pune and then officially at Justus-Liebig University, Giessen, Germany for research students. This course, although an advanced one, attracts students with a background of PDE, Probability Theory, Mathematical Finance, or Mathematical Physics.

noc22-ma46,Galois Theory,"Galois Theory is showpiece of a mathematical unification which brings together several different
branches of the subject and creating a powerful machine for the study problems of considerable
historical and mathematical importance. This course is an attempt to present the theory in such a
light, and in a manner suitable for undergraduate and graduate students as well as researchers.
This course will begin at the beginning. The quadratic formula for solving polynomials of degree
2 has been known for centuries and is still an important part of mathematics education. The
corresponding formulas for solving polynomials of degrees 3 and 4 are less familiar. These
expressions are more complicated than their quadratic counterpart, but the fact that they exist comes
as no surprise. It is therefore altogether unexpected that no such formulas are available for solving
polynomials of degree ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 5. A complete answer to this intriguing problem is provided by Galois
theory. In fact Galois theory was created precisely to address this and related questions about
polynomials. 
The participant is expected to have a basic knowledge of linear algebra, but other that the course is
largely self-contained. Most of what is needed from fields and elementary theory polynomials is
presented in the early lectures and much of the necessary group theory is also presented on the way.
Classical notions, statements and their proofs are provided in modern set-up. Numerous examples
are given to illustrate abstract notions. These examples are sort of an airport beacon, shining a
clear light at our destination as we navigate a course through the mathematical skies to get there.
Formally we cover the following topics :
ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Galois extensions and Fundamental theorem of Galois Theory.
ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Finite Fields, Cyclic Groups, Roots of Unity, Cyclotomic Fields.
ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Splitting fields, Algebraic closure
ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Normal and Separable extensions
ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Solvability of equations.

No previous knowledge is needed regarding fuzzy set theory or fuzzy logic. But familiarity with classical set theory, and two-valued logic will be helpful. In most real-life applications of any decision making one needs to face many types on uncertainty. While as humans we can deal with this uncertainty with our reasoning prowess it is not clear how to deal with this uncertainty in a system. Fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic gives us one way of representing this uncertainty and reasoning with them. This course is aimed at providing a strong background for the subject.

By examining some basic questions related to perspective drawing, like why parallel lines appear to converge in our vision, we can identify and analyze the defining properties of this space - properties which are well known to our visual sense, but defy our logical intuition.

As the course progresses, we will situate perspective drawing in the framework of Projective Geometry, and get familiar with the algebra of homogeneous coordinates, which will allow us to translate our sensory intuition into precise information we can easily communicate. We will also get to know the topological space known as the real projective plane, as well the matrix group that governs its transformations.

Being a four-week long elective, this course will nicely complement standard courses on geometry and topology, by giving hands-on experience with several important mathematical objects you will meet in those classes. Some basic linear algebra will be required, especially in the final week of the course (in particular, we will assume familiarity with vector calculus and with matrices as linear transformations).

As part of the series Our Mathematical Senses, we plan to offer follow-up courses in subsequent semesters, exploring our sense of spatial orientation (the Topology of Movement) and our sense of hearing (the Calculus of Sound)",Prof. Vijay Ravikumar,CMI,IIT Madras,2022-05-20,2022-07-25,NULL,NULL,2022-10-29,2022-10-29,NULL,https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc22_ma68/,NULL,NULL,Aug-Sep 2022,10,Rerun,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,upsc,https://archive.nptel.ac.in/content/syllabus_pdf/111106156.pdf,111,NULL,111106156,NULL,NULL,41,1,SEM2,4 ,ma,Mathematics

strain rates, i.e., flow stress dependence on strain rates. In addition, the failure mechanisms
under high strain rate loading conditions are generally different than those occur in low strain
rate. Furthermore, the deformation and failure mechanisms are controlled by the microstructure

noc22-mg102,Performance and Reward management,"In the present highly competitive environment, what organizations strive to uncover is, what is it that can take them ahead of their competitors? Or in other words, what can be their competitive advantage? The answer lies in what we have been considering for ages as human resources but indeed is the key organization resource; we refer to as, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“human capitalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â today. Any organization that succeeds in retaining motivated employees can pull off successfully in turbulent times by maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage through its motivated and talented human capital. But the question is; how to retain and make sure that an organization moves hand in hand with its human capital. Performance and Reward management is the key which offers a basis to an organization to turn and transform its human capital as its strategic business advantage. Performance management and reward management offers tool to an organization to not just retain its skilled workforce but to keep them motivated to perform to their best of ability. Many organizations have reported managing performances and designing an effective reward system as their key concern owing to diversified backgrounds and needs of the employees. The present course will offer a sound basis to the individuals who later will join as HR managers or practioners or HR learners in developing an understanding towards performance and management of human resources which indeed will always be relevant for an organization.

Cross border investments through direct/portfolio routes are also being enticed as a medium for funding of growth and developmental activities. In addition, the governments of developing nations continue to pursue their strategy of partial privatization of the frontier sectors in an attempt to raise revenues for the exchequer as well as reduce operational losses with increased efficiency. Under these stimuli, scientific investment management by the investor fraternity becomes of cardinal necessity for generating competitive returns and surviving in the marketplace. Financial instruments have proven to be immensely useful as versatile investment avenues. Their vitality can be gauged from the exponential growth in trading volumes as well as the advent of new structured products literally on a day to day basis. 
Most courses in this area do not cover investment theory as a cogent wholesome. They deliver the content in the asymptote rather than as a mainstream course focusing either on the purely stochastic underpinnings or emphasizing the trade-based orientation. The proposed course aims to provide valuable insights into the underlying financial nuances involved in investment management holistically.

With the increased participation of women in all walks of life, particularly at the workplace and the breaking of hitherto social, political and religious gender barriers, the issue has assumed significance and become subject- matter of debate at all levels including law. Today, women are donning multiple roles, apart from being a homemaker- they are working as top executives in MNCs, working as legislators in State and Central legislatures, working as educators in the education sector, etc. While the changed societal matrix & perception and economic globalization have made way for the increased participation of women, the concern over the free play of discriminatory attitudes and prejudicial mindsets often pose challenges to women and targets of multi-facet retaliations and disincentives. The incident of Nirbhaya in the Capital of the Nation not only exhibits how such treatment is basically an anathema to the concept of gender justice but also exposes the barbaric mindset annihilating the values of basic civilization. The days of yore when women were treated as fragile, feeble, dependent and subordinate to men, should be a matter of history.

noc22-mm48,Mine Closure and Sustainability Planning,"Mine Closure Planning is now mandatory for all mining operations in India and abroad. The national policies and standards practiced for reclamation and site restoration are now streamlined for regional sustainable development. The FR and DPR of any mining project now need to take care of detailed mine closure planning. Mining ventures are now committed to minimize the long lasting impacts on landscape, ecology and on the mind set of local inhabitants. Todayâ€™s mining operations require to pay careful attention to post closure societal impacts and post mining mine-site restoration while carrying out the present production as well as environmental and maintenance oriented activities. 
Mine closure related activities are to be aligned & integrated with various mining activities. Closing of mining operation involves numerous issues like reclamation and environmental protection, community issues, socio-economic consideration, planning for alternate use of available facilities, cost estimation and asset disposal. Mines must have continuously reviewed and updated closure plan, aimed at rehabilitation of disturbed area, which should be acceptable to local community as well as regulatory authority. The concepts of integrated closure planning to facilitate the activities at the closing phase of a mine need now serious and scientific deliberations. Development of mine closure plans requires understanding number of interrelated concepts and aligning with societal transformations. Without adequate environmental management system, cost effective mine closure or outcome based post-closure development of mine site is impossible. Sustainable development of the mining industry requires a holistic approach from exploration of resources to their exploitation as well as eco-friendly management of the waste material.

noc22-ph33,Neutron Scattering for Condensed Matter Studies,"The short-range strong interaction of neutron with matter and the inherent magnetic moment of neutron, makes neutron scattering a unique probe in condensed matter research. An important advantage of neutrons is that they carry no charge and can penetrate the bulk of materials. They interact via strong force with the nuclei of the material and the scattering cross section varies randomly between various elements and even between two isotopes of the same element. This allows one to observe light atoms such as hydrogen in the presence of heavier ones and distinguish neighbouring elements in the periodic table easily. Notably, hydrogen and deuterium have large contrast with respect to neutrons. One can exploit isotopic substitution and contrast variation methods in such studies. Since neutron also carries a magnetic moment of -1.91Î¼N, it also interacts with magnetic moment in atoms, making it a unique probe for determination of microscopic magnetic structure. Wavelength and energy of thermal neutron match with the lattice spacing and excitations in condensed matter and makes it an indispensable tool to study both structure and dynamics in condensed matter. Using neutron scattering techniques with varying momentum transfer and energy transfer range and resolution one is capable or understanding structure and dynamics in materials at various length and time scales.",Prof. Saibal Basu,Homi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI),IIT Bombay,2022-05-20,2022-07-25,NULL,NULL,2022-10-30,2022-10-30,NULL,https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc22_ph33/,NULL,NULL,Jul-Oct 2022,30,New,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,uplc,https://archive.nptel.ac.in/content/syllabus_pdf/115101131.pdf,115,NULL,115101131,NULL,NULL,42,1,SEM2,12,ph,Physics
